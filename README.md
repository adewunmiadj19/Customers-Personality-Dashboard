## Introduction
In an increasingly competitive market, X & Y Organization lacked a centralized, data-driven understanding of its customer base, spending behaviors, and early signs of customer disengagement. With millions of customers and significant income generation, there was no clear visibility into who the most valuable customers are, which products drive the most revenue, which sales channels are most effective, and which customer segments are at risk of churn.

The absence of these insights made it difficult to personalize marketing efforts, allocate resources effectively, or proactively manage customer retention.
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of customer’s behavior. It reveals who our most valuable customers are, where revenue is being generated, and where risks of customer loss exist. By identifying churn risk, optimizing sales channels, and segmenting customers effectively, this report equips the organization to make smarter, data-driven decisions.
